## About application

This application is created by using :bookmark_tabs: :
* `HTML` - hypertext markup language;
* `CSS` - style sheet language;
* `JavaScript` - programming language;
* `Web App Manifest` - is a `JSON` document that provides application metadata for `Progressive Web Apps`;

It takes the form of a `JavaScript` file that can control the web-page/site that it is associated with, intercepting and modifying navigation and resource requests, and caching resources in a very granular fashion to give you complete control over how your app behaves in certain situations (the most obvious one being when the network is not available).
